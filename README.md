# Dear Data by Ping

[Visit the site](https://deardata.yenpingchew.com)

This project is inspired by [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), where two designers send each other postcards illustrated with data that they've collected throughout the week.

I love the way they track and illustrate these different data points of their lives, which are kinda unconventional.

I'm taking a spin on their project, to push myself to do a few things:
1. Track unconventional and random data in my life, perhaps to think objectively about these parts of my lives.
2. Play around with these data and discover ways to illustrate them digitally.

### Data by weeks
1. 2019 Oct 20 - A week of negative emotions
2. 2019 Oct 28 - A week of positive emotions


### Technical details
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Data are illustrated with [Roughviz](https://github.com/jwilber/roughViz) (using the [React wrapper](https://github.com/Chris927/react-roughviz)).
